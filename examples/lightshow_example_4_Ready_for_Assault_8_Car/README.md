# **Running a 8-car show with cross-vehicle animations**

The light shows in this folder use the "Ready for Assault" music track that is in the Tesla 2024 Holiday Release Light Show.
These 8 shows have been customised to show animations that are coordinated across 8 vehicles such that effects combine to make a unique, unified show.

Each vehicle should be configured to run a scheduled show. See details in the main README.md file on the home page.

The vehicles should be arranged per this illustration:

Putting them in a circle is optional but recommended.

The shows can currently not be edited using the default xLights show folder.

The coordinated show will also work with fewer than 8 vehicles (e.g., 4 vehicles using shows 1, 2, 3 and 4).

### Requirements:
Running Software 2024.44.25.2 (2024 Holiday Release) or newer.
